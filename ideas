накидал тут на обеде:

FS dashboard with widgets

The main idea to display dashboard on TV in LIVE mode
+ post a screenshoot of dashboard to slack every morning (helpful for remote devs and who isn't in the office)

For interface design inspiration: https://airtame.com/blog/top-kpi-dashboards/

Widgets ideas:
Current instagram images/stories + strava activities
Days until friday
Tweet of day (we can post a tweet to our dashboard via some slack bot or simply use some endpoint)
Team members current location (display map with zooming)
Days since last grcprd (data from JIRA)
Birthdays today + upcoming (data from Notion)
PTOs today + upcoming (data from Notion)
On monitoring this week (who is on duty this week? data from Confluence)
Company events today + upcoming (source? probably manually)
Some stats from Yva

Optional ideas:
Btc currency
Top conversation tags from slack
Office wish list
HN current top 3
